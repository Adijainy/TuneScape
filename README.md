## Features

- #### **Anonymous Login**

  Tunescape allows users to log in anonymously, ensuring privacy while still enabling participation in the listening experience.

- #### **Create Private or Public Lobby**

  Users have the option to create their own private lobbies for exclusive listening sessions with friends or colleagues. Alternatively, they can explore public lobbies to join larger communities of music enthusiasts.

- #### **Join Private Lobby with Lobby Code**

  To join a private lobby, users simply need to enter the lobby code provided by the host. This ensures that only invited individuals can access the private listening session.

- #### **Explore and Join Public Lobbies**

  Users can browse through a list of public lobbies and join any that pique their interest. This feature encourages social interaction and the discovery of new music among a wider audience.

- #### **Synchronized Listening**

  All users within a lobby experience synchronized playback of the selected songs, creating a shared listening experience regardless of geographical location.

- #### **Leader Controls**

  The host of the lobby, known as the leader, has exclusive control over the music queue and playback. They can add songs to the queue, skip to the next or previous track, and play/pause the music for all participants.

- #### **Listener Mode**
  Participants in the lobby who are not designated as leaders have limited control and can only tune in to the synchronized music playback. This ensures a cohesive listening experience without the risk of interference from multiple users.
